                Before starting the Web Development Course at General Assembly, I was a simple server in Macon, Ga. There came a point in my life where I decided that I wanted to do more and be more in life. My partner has a background in IT services and brought Web Development to my attention. I proceeded to look through online courses and books, just looking to see if it would be something of interest to me. Fast-forward six months, and I was starting this course with a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. I have since expanded my knowledge of coding languages and gained several methods to improve my skills.
